# Computational Physics

One of my areas of research is the intersection between theoretical physics and computational physics. More specifically, I 
like to look at problems in theoretical physics with no analytical solution (and often giant and messy equations) and use
numerical methods to solve them.

I will frequently upload example problems from undergraduate courses like classical mechanics and quantum mechanics that 
require numerical methods to solve. The language used will mainly be python, but there is a possibility of examples involving 
c++.

I will also be uploading work from my own research, including the work I did to solve the problem that is explained in more detail in 
my most recent publication: [I'm an inline-style link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00074)
