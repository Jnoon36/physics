## Relativistic Description of Confined Hydrogen-Atoms

This numerical computation is based off of my recent [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00074) submission. I try to provide as much detail as I can in the code about what specifically I'm doing at each step and why. Below will be an abstract from my paper on the problem.

# Abstract

We make use of the Dirac equation to provide a relativistic calculation of the binding energy of a hydrogen-like atom confined within a penetrable spherical barrier. We take the potential to be Coulombic within the barrier and constant outside the barrier. The derived energy values are compared with the energy values obtained from a non-relativistic calculation based on the Schrodinger equation, where significant differences are found for small values of the barrier radius. In addition, we show that without the introduction of the principle quantum number n, all energy states of the confined atom, determined by a single quantum number k, transfer into the known energy states of the free atom as the radius of the barrier becomes large.
