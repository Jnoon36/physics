# Particle in a Finite Square Well

The computations carried out here help solve a problem that all undergraduate physics students should perform. 
This program will be used to solve for the energy eigenvalues of a particle in a finite square well, with potential energy V(x)
= -V_0, where V_0 equal to a positive constant, and width 2a, with also equal to a positive constant. A specific example can be
found in Griffiths' Quantum Mechanics. Energy for this system cannot be solved analytically, so we will use a root finding 
method, namely the bisection method.

The variable to be solved for is x, which is a function of E (energy). The paramter used is x_0, which is a function of the 
well depth V_0 and the width a. In Griffiths' Quantum mechanics, these variable substitutions were used to make the equations 
look a little nicer. Therefore, the goal we are after here is a qualitative representation of the energy states of the particle
in the finite square well, not the actual energy values.
