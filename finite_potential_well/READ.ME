# Particle in a Finite Square Well

The computations carried out here help solve a problem that all undergraduate physics students should perform. 
This program will be used to solve for the energy eigenvalues of a particle in a finite square well, with potential energy V(x)
= -V_0, where V_0 equal to a positive constant, and width 2a, with also equal to a positive constant. A specific example can be
found in Griffiths' Quantum Mechanics. Energy for this system cannot be solved analytically, so we will use a root finding 
method, namely the bisection method.

The variable to be solved for is x, which is a function of E (energy). The paramter used is x_0, which is a function of the 
well depth V_0 and the width a. In Griffiths' Quantum mechanics, these variable substitutions were used to make the equations 
look a little nicer. Therefore, the goal we are after here is a qualitative representation of the energy states of the particle
in the finite square well, not the actual energy values.

# Goals
1. Define a function that uses the bisection method for solving zeros of a function
2. Define the function for the symmetric states and the anti-symmetric states (which we will find the zeros of later)
3. Both of the functions above come from Griffiths, and they are technically equal to zero. Therefore, the RHS is equal to the
sqrt function. Plot both tan and cot functions with the sqrt function to see where they intersect (which will be the zeros!)
4. Use the root finding method defined above to solve for the zeros of both of our functions, while varying x_0
5. Fit polynomials through the data points (roots) and plot them with the data points
